# Software and Tooling

Software and development tooling is handled a little differently on M3 than you might be used to because of its unique file system. In particular, because M3 is a shared file system, you do not have access to `sudo`, and you cannot install software on the system manually. Instead, you will need to use the `module` command to load software and development tools.
