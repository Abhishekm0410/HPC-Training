# Welcome

Welcome and congratulations on joining the HPC team. This is the HPC Training Book which contains the training material which will be used to train you in many of the preliminary HPC concepts required to participate in the HPC branch and in MDN as a whole. Throughout this book you will learn the basics of the C programming language, parallel and distributed computing and job batching. You will complete challenges across the weeks to test your knowledge and give you the opportunity to practice your skills.
